This is a worksheet of sorts intended to be used after working through [Michael Hartl's Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book). It contains a few concepts I think are important to learn before looking for your first developer job that the book either didn't cover or only mentioned briefly.

This was made based on a series I wrote about called ["How to Become a Developer."](https://johnmosesman.com/post/how-to-become-a-developer/)
